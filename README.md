# SudoCode
SUDOCODE: SudoCode as the name suggests, is a supreme coding tool for everyone. Using SudoCode, one can start programming with actually knowing the coding language (in this case C or C++). This particular tool helps in converting a given pseudocode to a code in either C.  Code readability and code quality are improved to a large extent. Using this tool, our time is also saved to a large extent. It cleans the code, and makes sure the indentations are in the right manner. PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM: The purpose of this tool is to help budding programmers focus on logic and save time, and let the tool bring out the code in the desired language (C in this case). It helps bring proper indentation, and an error free final code. It improves code readability and quality. EXISTING SYSTEM: Here, we have a test code, i.e. the pseudocode which we run in out main file. We run this on a shell platform (on google cloud services) where on running the pseudocode in our main code, we get the output, we convert it internally to C code and Hence, give the output. The functionalities that can be performed here are, for loop, while loop, function definition and calling etc. PROPOSED SYSTEM: Itâ€™s a fairly simple project, and does not involve any machine learning at this stage, but implementing this using machine language is a part of the development process.
